For Interval Based:

Most of the Interval based problems require sorting
1)sort the intervals (mostly on the second number)
2) check for condition if it overlaps with previous intervals

For stack : 

Use single iteration to check the condition and push the elemnt into stack, like this 

for(int j = 0;j<n;j++){
            while(!st.empty() and temperatures[j] > temperatures[st.top()]){
               int i = st.top();
               st.pop();
               ans[i] = j - i; // 1 - 0 ==> 40 - 30
            }
            st.push(j); //for first element directly insert and for next we can check condition and then insert
        }
