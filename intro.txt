Hi, I’m Satyam Srivastava. I’m glad to be here today. 
I have two years of experience as a software developer at Persistent Systems.
 I’ve mainly worked on backend development using Java with Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and Node.js.

In my role, I built and improved APIs and focused on making our systems run better. 
I enjoy solving problems and love writing clean, efficient code.

I’m excited about the opportunity at Swiggy and look forward to tackling new challenges together.
